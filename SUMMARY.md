**BUP19: Sweet Pepper Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, object detection, and monocular depth estimation tasks. It is used in the agricultural industry. 

The dataset consists of 572 images with 7448 labeled objects belonging to 4 different classes including *black pepper*, *green pepper*, *mixed pepper*, and other: *red pepper*.

Images in the BUP19 dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (228 images), *test* (176 images), and *val* (168 images). Additionally, every image in train dataset marked with ***alireza*** or ***claus*** tag. The dataset was released in 2019 by the University of Bonn, Germany.
