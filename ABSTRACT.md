The authors release **BUP19: Sweet Pepper Dataset** to explore the issue of generalisability of the large differences between cropping environments by considering a fruit (sweet pepper) that is grown using different cultivars (sub-species) and in different environments (field vs glasshouse).

The field of agricultural robotics is experiencing rapid growth, driven by advancements in computer vision, machine learning, and robotics, coupled with an increasing demand in agriculture. Despite these strides, a significant gap exists between the technology available and the diverse requirements of farming, primarily due to the substantial variations in cropping environments. This underscores the urgent need for models with enhanced generalizability.

Addressing this gap, the BUP19 dataset was meticulously curated, encompassing diverse domains, cultivars, cameras, and geographic locations. The authors leverage this dataset in both individual and combined approaches to assess the detection and classification of sweet peppers in the wild. They opt for Faster-RCNN for detection, benefiting from its seamless adaptability to multitask learning through the incorporation of the Mask-RCNN framework for instance-based segmentation.

In evaluating sub-class classification, with a focus on the accuracy of correct detections, the authors achieve an impressive accuracy score of 0.9 in cross-domain evaluations. Notably, their experiments reveal that intra-environmental inference tends to be suboptimal. However, by enriching the data through a combination of diverse datasets, the authors enhance performance by introducing greater diversity into the training data.

In summary, the presentation of unique and varied datasets exemplifies the capacity of multi-task learning to improve cross-dataset generalization. Concurrently, it emphasizes the crucial role of diverse data in the efficient training and evaluation of real-world systems.
